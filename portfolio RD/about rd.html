      <h1>Short Biography</h1>

<p>Hi! I'm Ambi, a senior jounralism major and creative wiriting minor at the Univeristy of Maryland, College Park.
  As a young girl, I have always expressed a passion for writing. I started writing fanfiction for the Harry Potter series around 10 years old and then discovered my love for poetry in middle school. During High School, I started participating
    in school poetry open mics and became a member of the Clarksburg Literary Magazine.
  </p>

<p> During my junior year at UMD, I became President of Terpoets (UMD's poetry club) and hosted and performed poetry open mics and events around campus.
    Also during my junior year, I took a Woman in Comedy class and felt a high for stand up comedy. I started particpating in open mics at Milkboy Arthouse and felt there was a lack of stand up female comedians. I then started UMD's all female
  comedy group: The Hysterics. Where we perform in Stand up, Improv, and Sketch Comedy.

      </p>

        <p>During my senior year, I opened for Nikki Glaser at the DC improv and found a new creative outlit: photography, thanks to my photojournalism class.
        I started taking photos about Campus life and comedy shows. Then I decided to lauch my brand, "Creative Ambi" on social media (@ambitheartist) show casing my creative outlets: Poetry, Photography, and Comedy.
      </p>
